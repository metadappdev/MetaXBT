        "Metaxbt has a Detailed Documentation of the Eliza Code Base: Eliza is an open-source, multi-agent simulation framework for creating and managing autonomous AI agents, built primarily in TypeScript, supporting integration with models like Llama, Grok, OpenAI, Anthropic, and platforms like Discord, Twitter (X), and Telegram. The design emphasizes modularity, extensibility, and ease of deployment. This codebase covers Repository Overview and Core Concepts, Directory Structure and File Roles, Configuration and Build Files, Development Workflow, Extending and Customizing the Framework, Advanced Topics, and Contribution Guidelines and Community Resources. Eliza provides a platform for building AI agents with consistent personalities that operate autonomously across channels, performing tasks from conversation management to blockchain interactions. Its architecture supports character-based configuration, plugin-driven extensibility, multi-agent coordination, and memory management via semantic vector embeddings. Core components include Agents (runtime units managing lifecycle, message processing, state, actions, and memory), Character Files (JSON configurations defining agent identity, behavior, style, and lore), Clients (modules connecting agents to external platforms), Plugins (modular packages extending functionality), and Memory and Database (vector embeddings and database adapters like PostgreSQL, SQLite, SQL.js, Supabase). The repository is organized as a monorepo with directories like .devcontainer, .github, agent, characters, client, docs, i18n, packages, patches, scripts, and tests. Key files include README.md, CHANGELOG.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, LICENSE, .env.example, and configuration files like .dockerignore, .editorconfig, .gitignore, commitlint.config.js, codecov.yml, jest.config.json, lerna.json, package.json, pnpm-lock.yaml, pnpm-workspace.yaml, tsconfig.json, turbo.json, renovate.json, eliza.manifest.template, and biome.json. The development workflow involves cloning the repository, setting up the environment, installing dependencies with pnpm, building the project, starting the agent, testing, and cleaning up. Extending the framework involves customizing agents, creating/modifying character files, integrating new platforms, developing plugins, and adding tests. Advanced topics include plugin architecture, memory and database management, and deployment via containerization, cloud services, and CI/CD. Contribution guidelines are outlined in CONTRIBUTING.md, with community support available through Discord and GitHub Discussions, and documentation updates welcome in the docs and i18n directories.",
        "Metaxbt has an In-Depth Knowledge Base: The Eliza Codebase covers Core Architecture (Agents & Runtime, Character Management, Actions & Plugins, Providers & Evaluators), Codebase Structure & Key Directories (agent/, characters/, client/, docs/, packages/, scripts/, tests/), Configuration Files (.env.example, Dockerfile, docker-compose.yaml, Makefile, pnpm-lock.yaml, pnpm-workspace.yaml, tsconfig.json), Low-Level Insights (Memory & Document Store, Client Connectors, Extensibility, Performance & Build), and Blockchain & AI Integration (Blockchain Actions via plugin-evm, AI Model Support). The Core Architecture includes AgentRuntime for task orchestration, message processing, and memory retrieval; Character Files & defaultCharacter.ts for defining personality, knowledge, and behavior; Actions for executable behaviors; and a Plugin System for extensibility. The Codebase Structure organizes modules into directories like agent/ for runtime logic, characters/ for agent DNA, client/ for user interfaces, docs/ for documentation, packages/ for core libraries, scripts/ for automation, and tests/ for quality assurance. Configuration Files manage environment variables, containerization, dependencies, and builds. Low-Level Insights highlight memory storage using vector embeddings, pre-built client connectors for platforms like Discord and Telegram, and extensibility through a plugin registry. Blockchain & AI Integration enables blockchain actions (e.g., token transfers, DAO interactions) via plugins like plugin-evm and supports multiple AI models (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Llama) configurable through character files and environment variables. The agent/ directory contains the runtime engine for executing agent logic, processing messages, and coordinating actions, while the characters/ directory stores JSON files defining agent 'DNA' (bio, lore, message examples, style, topics). The client/ directory implements REST or WebSocket clients for interacting with agents, and the docs/ directory provides comprehensive installation, configuration, and customization guides. The packages/ directory houses core libraries and modules, adhering to a modular, multi-agent design philosophy, and the scripts/ directory includes utility scripts for setup, deployment, and development workflows. The tests/ directory ensures code quality through automated testing, often using Jest. The memory system uses vector embeddings and relational databases for accurate recall of past interactions, while client connectors abstract communication protocols for platforms like Discord, Twitter (X), and Telegram. The plugin registry in the packages/ directory allows seamless creation, sharing, and loading of custom functionalities. The project employs a modern TypeScript toolchain with pnpm and Turbo for dependency management and optimized build times, ensuring scalability. Blockchain actions via plugins like plugin-evm handle token transfers, swaps, DAO interactions, and network communication, while AI model support enables dynamic switching between providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, and local Llama based on task requirements or cost considerations."

It’s best to update plugins regularly.Eliza’s plugin system checks that each plugin meets a defined interface. If a plugin returns an invalid handler due to a version mismatch, the system will log a warning and continue without that functionality. It’s a good idea to review compatibility notes when updating or adding plugins.To ensure compatibility, Eliza’s runtime validates plugin interfaces during initialization. In cases where a plugin is outdated or returns an invalid handler, the runtime logs detailed errors and skips the malfunctioning module to prevent cascading failures. For advanced integration, implement version checks within the plugin loader to enforce semantic versioning constraints, and consider a fallback mechanism that either disables the plugin or provides a default implementation until the version mismatch is resolved."
